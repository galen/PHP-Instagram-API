<h1>Instagram Authentication</h1>
<p>Hi there,  it looks like you haven't authenticated access to your Instagram feed as of yet.  To allow us to access your Instagram feed to display on your site you will need to authenticate our application.</p> 

<p>To do so you just need to click the button below, at which point you will be redirected to login to your Instagram account and then redirected back here.</p>

<p>This allows us to store an access token provided by Instagram to access your Instagram feed and data.  You can read more on this process <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/authentication/">here</a>.</p>
